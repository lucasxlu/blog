## Competition
* My algorithm named **TreeNet** ranks the 1st place on **Facial Expression Recognition Challenge** on [Real-word Affective Face Database (RAF-DB)](http://www.whdeng.cn/raf/model1.html).


## Experience
* [Pig Face Recognition](http://gd.people.com.cn/n2/2018/0323/c123932-31374601.html)  
  Our team developed a **Pig Face Recognition System** with [Guangzhou Yingzi Holding Co.,Ltd](http://www.yingzi.com/), to accurately recognize a pig and get its detailed information through captured photo. It achieves a mAP over 95%.   
  * Building deep model and training on Amazon S3 GPU server.
  * Encapsulate RESTful API and web backend development.
  
  
* Mal-Image Recognition System  
  I developed a Mal-Image Recognition System with [Wuhan ZhiLiFeng Information .,Ltd.](http://zlfinfo.com.cn/), the model achieves a mAP with 92.17% on detecting mal-images.  
  * Image data crawling and preprocessing.
  * Building machine learning algorithms.
  * Model training and deployment.


* Web Crawling and Java Developer  
  During working at [Beijing Jiewen Technology Co.,Ltd.](http://www.jiewen.com.cn/), Huazhong Developing Center. My duties are developing and maintaining financial information system, and developing web crawling system based on Java and Python.
  * Developing and maintaining web information system based on Java SSM framework and MySQL database.
  * Developing web crawlers to collect data from O2O websites (e.g. [Ctrip](http://www.ctrip.com/), [Dazhong Dianping](http://www.dianping.com/), [AMap](https://www.amap.com/)), and storing them in MySQL and MongoDB.
  * Data statistics, analysis and visualization.
