## Projects
* [XCloud](https://github.com/lucasxlu/CVLH.git)  
  An AI cloud platform based on Java, to provide RESTful APIs in web data crawling, text classification, sentiment analysis, document   similarity measuring, image classification and HTML5-based data visualization.
* [Lagou Job](https://github.com/lucasxlu/LagouJob.git)  
  A repository for job data crawling and data analysis based on Python3. This repo has received over __200+ stars__ and __120+ forks__. More details can be read at [here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/36132174/answer/94392659).

## Competition
* My algorithm named _TreeNet_ ranks the 1st place on _Facial Expression Recognition Challenge_ on [Real-word Affective Face Database (RAF-DB)](http://www.whdeng.cn/raf/model1.html).


## Experience
* [Pig Face Recognition](http://gd.people.com.cn/n2/2018/0323/c123932-31374601.html)  
  Our team developed a _Pig Face Recognition System_ with [Guangzhou Yingzi Holding Co.,Ltd](http://www.yingzi.com/), to accurately recognize a pig and get its detailed information through captured photo. It achieves a mAP over 95%.   
  * Building deep model and training on Amazon S3 GPU server.
  * Encapsulate RESTful API and web backend development.
  
  
* Mal-Image Recognition System  
  I developed a Mal-Image Recognition System with [Wuhan ZhiLiFeng Information .,Ltd.](http://zlfinfo.com.cn/), the model achieves a mAP with 92.17% on detecting mal-images.  
  * Image data crawling and preprocessing.
  * Building machine learning algorithms.
  * Model training and deployment.


* Web Crawling and Java Developer  
  During working at [Beijing Jiewen Technology Co.,Ltd.](http://www.jiewen.com.cn/), Huazhong Developing Center. My duties are developing and maintaining financial information system, and developing web crawling system based on Java and Python.
  * Developing and maintaining web information system based on Java SSM framework and MySQL database.
  * Developing web crawlers to collect data from O2O websites (e.g. [Ctrip](http://www.ctrip.com/), [Dazhong Dianping](http://www.dianping.com/), [AMap](https://www.amap.com/)), and storing them in MySQL and MongoDB.
  * Data statistics, analysis and visualization.
